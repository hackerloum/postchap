Content & creation
Templates library – Pre-made layouts (product launch, event, promo, quote) so users pick a style and only change copy/branding.
Bulk create – Generate multiple posters in one go (e.g. “5 variations for this week”) from one brief or occasion.
Export / calendar view – Calendar of scheduled posts and “Export for Instagram/Facebook” (sizes + optional CSV of dates/copy).
Reuse / duplicate – “Duplicate & edit” from My Posters and “Save as template” from a poster they like.
A/B copy variants – Generate 2–3 headline/CTA variants per poster and let user pick or schedule both to compare.
Brand & consistency
Brand voice / tone presets – Save “formal / casual / playful” per brand kit and apply automatically to all generation.
Approval workflow (Business) – Draft → “Submit for approval” → approver approves/rejects before it goes to schedule or export.
Asset library – Upload logos, product shots, key visuals once; reuse in posters (you already have logo in brand kit; extend to “brand assets”).
Analytics & insights
Usage dashboard – Posters created this month, limit used (e.g. 12/50), next reset; link to upgrade for Pro/Business.
Recommendation insights – “Trending in your industry/country this week” or “Best times to post” based on their country/industry.
Simple performance (optional) – If they connect a social account (later), “Top performing posts” to inspire future posters.
Schedule & distribution
Best time suggestion – When they set schedule, show “Peak times in Tanzania” (or their country) and suggest 1–2 slots.
Multi-slot (Pro/Business) – Allow 2–3 scheduled times per day (e.g. morning + evening) instead of a single daily time.
Reminders – “Post ready: [link]. Post to Instagram by 2pm” (email or in-app) so schedule actually turns into real posts.
Monetization & growth
Annual billing – “Pay yearly, save 2 months” (e.g. Pro $120/year instead of $12×12) to improve LTV and churn.
Referral program – “Invite a friend: they get 1 month Pro, you get 1 month free” (or similar); track with a code or link.
Team / seats (Business) – Multiple users per workspace, role “creator” vs “approver”, count seats in plan limits.
UX & onboarding
Onboarding checklist – “Complete profile → Create first poster → Set schedule” with checkmarks on dashboard.
First-poster nudge – If they’ve never generated, dashboard CTA: “Create your first poster in 60 seconds.”
Country/currency in profile – Let them set/change country (and see correct price) without re-running full onboarding.
Notification preferences – Email: payment success, schedule reminder, “you’ve used 80% of your poster limit.”
Platform & trust
Changelog / What’s new – Small “What’s new” section or modal so power users see new templates, features, or limits.
Help / tooltips – Short tooltips on “Scheduled generation”, “Recommendations”, and pricing (e.g. “We’ll create 1 poster at your chosen time”).
Status page – Simple “All systems operational” (or incident) page linked from footer for trust.
Quick wins to do first
Templates library – Big perceived value, reuses existing generation flow.
Usage dashboard – Surfaces limits and naturally pushes upgrades.
Annual billing – One config + pricing page change, good for revenue.
Onboarding checklist + first-poster nudge – Better activation with limited new screens.
Country/currency in profile – Fixes “wrong price” for users who didn’t set country in the wizard.
